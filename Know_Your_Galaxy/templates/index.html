        <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">"The Sun, Earth, and the other planets of the solar system are part of the Milky Way galaxy. Most galaxies move through the universe as part of clusters, or groups, of galaxies. The Milky Way is at one end of a cluster called the Local Group. It includes about 40 galaxies. The largest galaxy in the Local Group is the Andromeda Galaxy.Even the smaller galaxies are made up of millions of stars. These galaxies may be 5,000 light-years across. (A light-year is the distance light travels in a year—about 5.8 trillion miles, or 9.5 trillion kilometers.) The Milky Way is roughly 20 times larger than that. It includes hundreds of billions of stars. The largest galaxies are even more huge and contain trillions of stars.Galaxies are divided into three main categories based on their shapes: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. Spiral galaxies look like pinwheels. They have a central disk and two or more curved arms winding outward. The disk consists mainly of older stars, while the arms have younger stars. The arms contain much dust and gas, from which new stars can form. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy.

          An elliptical galaxy may be shaped like a round ball or may be more stretched out, like an American football. It has more stars near its center and fewer stars in its outer regions. Elliptical galaxies vary widely in size. Small elliptical galaxies are the most common kind of galaxy in the universe.
          
          Unusually shaped galaxies are called irregular galaxies. They are not very common. Many of them have no obvious center point. Some of them appear to be the result of a crash between several galaxies."</p>

          <div><p class="fs-2">The Sun</p>
            <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.

              The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 astronomical unit (1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
              
              The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy.
              
              About 4 to 7 billion years from now, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. After the red giant phase, models suggest the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for perhaps trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off negligible energy.
              
              Etymology
              The English word sun developed from Old English sunne. Cognates appear in other Germanic languages, including West Frisian sinne, Dutch zon, Low German Sünn, Standard German Sonne, Bavarian Sunna, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.[17][18] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin sōl, ancient Greek ἥλιος (hēlios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as well as (with *l > r) Sanskrit स्वर् (svár) and Persian خور (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well, as *sōwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunnō) and Old Norse prosaic sól (alongside poetic sunna), and through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic sól, etc.[18]
              
              The principal adjectives for the Sun in English are sunny for sunlight and, in technical contexts, solar (/ˈsoʊlər/),[3] from Latin sol.[19] From the Greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac (/ˈhiːliæk/).[20] In English, the Greek and Latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios (/ˈhiːliəs/) and Sol (/ˈsɒl/),[2][1] while in science fiction Sol may be used to distinguish the Sun from other stars. The term sol with a lowercase s is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as Mars.[21]
              
              The astronomical symbol for the Sun is a circle with a center dot, ☉.[22] It is used for such units as M☉ (Solar mass), R☉ (Solar radius) and L☉ (Solar luminosity).[23][24] The scientific study of the Sun is called heliology.[25]</p>

          <div><p class="fs-2">The Milky Way</p>
            <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy around 13.6 billion years old with large pivoting arms stretching out across the cosmos. 

              Milky Way quick facts:
              –  Galaxy type: Barred spiral
              – Age: 13.6 billion years (and counting)
              – Size: 100,000 light-years across
              – Number of stars: about 200 billion
              – Rotation time: 250 million years
              
              Our home galaxy's disk is about 100,000 light-years in diameter and just 1000 light-years thick, according to Las Cumbres Observatory.
              
               Just as Earth orbits the sun, the solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way. Despite hurtling through space at speeds of around 515,000mph (828,000kmph) our solar system takes approximately 250 million years to complete a single revolution, according to Interesting Engineering. The last time our planet was in this position, dinosaurs were just emerging and mammals were yet to evolve. On a clear night, void of light pollution, we can catch a glimpse of the bright lights of the galactic city streaking across the night sky. Our window into the universe, this milky white band of stars, dust and gas is where our galaxy gets its name.

               Lying at the very heart of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*. About 4 million times the mass of the sun, this beast consumes anything that strays too close, gorging on an ample supply of stellar material enabling it to grow into a giant. In 2022, we imaged this glutton at the core of our galaxy for the very first time, through an innovative technique allowing us to view the shadow of the black hole. </p>
               <p class="fs-3">Why we called our solar system Milky Way</p>
               <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">According to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), our galactic home is called the Milky Way after its apparent milky white appearance as it stretches across the night sky. In Greek mythology, this milky band appeared because the goddess Hera sprayed milk across the sky. 

                Around the world, the Milky Way is known by different names. For example in China it is called "Silver River" and in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa it's called the "Backbone of Night".  </p>

            <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">"Since the first exoplanet was confirmed orbiting a sunlike star in 1995, scientists have discovered over 5,000 of these distant worlds.

              More than half of these discoveries were made by NASA's Kepler space telescope, which launched in 2009 to determine how common Earth-like planets are throughout the Milky Way galaxy. The Kepler space telescope was retired in 2018 having discovered more than 2,600 exoplanets.
              
              Discovering the first true "alien Earth" is a long-held dream of astronomers — and recent exoplanet discoveries have shown that small, rocky worlds like our own are abundant in our galaxy. For a planet to be considered potentially life-friendly, it must be relatively small and rocky, and it must orbit within the habitable or "Goldilocks" zone of its star. This zone is loosely defined as a region where water can exist in liquid form on the planet's surface. As telescope technology advances, additional factors like the planet's atmospheric composition and the activity level of its parent star are also taken into account."</p>
              <p class="fs-3">1. GLIESE 667cc</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">Gliese 667Cc lies just 22 light-years from Earth, and is at least 4.5 times as massive as Earth, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Gliese 667Cc completes one orbit around its host star in a mere 28 days, but that star is a red dwarf considerably cooler than the sun, so the exoplanet is thought to lie in the habitable zone.

                However, Gliese 667Cc, discovered using the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-meter telescope in Chile, might orbit close enough to its red dwarf star to be scorched by flares.</p>
              <p class="fs-3">2. KEPLER 22B</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">Kepler-22b lies 600 light-years away. It was the first Kepler planet found in the habitable zone of its parent star, but the world is considerably larger than Earth — about 2.4 times our planet's size. It's unclear if this "super-Earth" planet is rocky, liquid or gaseous. 

                Kepler-22b's orbit of 290 days is fairly similar to Earth's 365, Space.com previously reported. The exoplanet orbits a G-class star like our sun, but this star is smaller and colder than Earth's. </p>
              <p class="fs-3">3. KEPLER 69C</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">Kepler-69c, which is about 2,700 light-years away, is about 70 percent larger than Earth. So, once again, researchers are unsure about its composition.

                The planet completes an orbit every 242 days, positioning it similarly to Venus in our solar system. However, since Kepler-69c's host star is about 80 percent as luminous as the sun, the planet appears to reside in the habitable zone.</p>
              <p class="fs-3">4. KEPLER 62F</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">Kepler-62f is about 40 percent larger than Earth and orbits a star much cooler than our sun, according to NASA. Its 267-day orbit, however, puts Kepler-62f squarely within the habitable zone. While Kepler-62 orbits closer to its red dwarf star than Earth does to the sun, the star produces much less light.

                Kepler-62f lies about 1,200 light-years away and, due to its large size, is within the range of potentially rocky planets that may hold oceans. </p>
              <p class="fs-3">5. KEPLER 186F</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">This planet is at most 10 percent larger than Earth, and it also appears to reside in the habitable zone of its star, though on the zone's outer edge; Kepler-186f receives just one-third of the energy from its star that Earth gets from the sun.

                Kepler-186f's parent star is a red dwarf, so the alien world is not a true Earth twin. The planet lies about 500 light-years from Earth.</p>
              <p class="fs-3">6. KEPLER 442B</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">Kepler-442b is 33 percent larger than Earth and completes an orbit of its star every 112 days, according to a NASA press release. The discovery of Kepler-442, situated 1,194 light-years away from Earth, was announced in 2015. 

                One study, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2021, found that this exoplanet may receive enough light to sustain a large biosphere. The researchers analyzed the likelihood of different planets being able to carry out photosynthesis. They found that Kepler-442b receives sufficient radiation from its star.</p>
              <p class="fs-3">7. KEPLER 452B</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">This world, whose discovery was announced in 2015, is the first near-Earth-size planet that orbits around a star the size of the sun, according to NASA exoplanets. Kepler-452b is 60 percent larger than Earth and its parent star (Kepler-452) is 10 percent larger than the sun. Kepler-452 is very similar to our sun, and the exoplanet orbits in the habitable zone. 

                At 1.6 times the size of Earth, Kepler-452b has a "better than even chance" of being rocky, its discoverers have said. Kepler-452b resides 1,400 light-years from Earth. It takes Kepler-452b just 20 days longer to orbit its star than Earth does.</p>
              <p class="fs-3">8. KEPLER 1649C</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">When the data from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope was reanalyzed, scientists discovered Kepler 1649c. The exoplanet was found to be similar in size to Earth and orbiting in its star's habitable zone.

                During the initial data collection from the telescope, a computer algorithm misidentified the astronomical body, according to NASA, but in 2020 it was discovered to be a planet. 
                
                Kepler-1649c is located 300 light-years from Earth and is only 1.06 times larger than it. When comparing the light that the two planets receive from their stars, scientists found that this exoplanet receives 75 percent of the light Earth does from the sun.  </p>
              <p class="fs-3">9. PROXIMA CENTAURIB</p>
              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">Proxima Centauri b is located just four light-years away from Earth, making it Earth's closest known exoplanet, according to NASA.  The exoplanet, which was discovered in 2016, has a mass that is 1.27 times that of Earth's.

                Although the exoplanet can be found in the habitable zone of its star, Proxima Centauri, it is exposed to extreme ultraviolet radiation. This is because it lies very close to its parent star and has an orbital period of just 11.2 days.

              <p class="text-end fs-5 fst-italic px-15">Orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 are the most Earth-sized planets ever discovered in the habitable zone of a single star. This planetary system is made up of seven worlds. 

                Water on most of these planets is likely to have evaporated early in the system's formation, Space.com previously reported.  However, a 2018 study found that some of these planets could hold more water than Earth's oceans. One of the worlds, called TRAPPIST-1e, is thought to be the most likely to support life as we know it.  </p>

              <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime wherein gravity is so strong that no matter or electromagnetic energy (e.g. light) can escape it.[2] Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>
